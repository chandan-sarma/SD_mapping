# A low-circuit-depth quantum computing approach to the nuclear shell model
This repository contains the code used to study the ground state of lighter mass nuclei: (6-9)Li, 18F, and two heavy mass nuclei: 210Po and 210Pb, using the shell model approach together with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver approach (arXiv:2510.02124).
