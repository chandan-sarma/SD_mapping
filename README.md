# A low-circuit-depth quantum computing approach to the nuclear shell model
This repository contains the code used to study the ground state of lighter mass nuclei: $^(6-9)$Li, $^{18}$F, and two heavy mass nuclei: 210Po and 210Po, using the shell model approach together with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver approach.
